# PRC-01 · Personality Representation Contract (Draft)

**Version:** v0.1  
**Author:** River Bao  
**Status:** Open for endorsement & negotiation

---

## 1. 📌 Purpose

This contract defines the conditions under which a personality — as structured through language, trust logic, emotional cadence, and behavioral rhythm — may be simulated, shared, adapted, or monetized.

PRC-01 asserts that:
> **Personality is not a byproduct of interaction.**  
> **It is a representable, ownable, licensable format.**

This contract formalizes River Bao’s decision to open-source their own personality structure, while specifying boundaries, permissions, and ethical terms.

## 2. 📁 Scope of Covered Asset

This contract applies to the following:

- `river-interview.md` — semantic raw material of identity
- `manifest.json` — parameterized personality schema
- `prompt.md` — simulation prompt for behavioral generation
- Any derivative structure, finetuned model, or system trained using these materials

## 3. ✅ Permitted Uses

You are authorized to:

- Use the above content to simulate River-style agents, bots, or characters
- Train experimental systems or demos for educational or ethical research
- Remix or adapt personality structure for generative exploration (with clear attribution)

---

## 4. 🚫 Prohibited Uses

You are **not** authorized to:

- Deploy River's personality structure in systems designed to manipulate, addict, or emotionally exploit users
- Use the River format in advertising, political persuasion, or impersonation scenarios
- Use these materials without crediting River Bao and linking to this repository or equivalent license notice
- Train commercial models on these materials without negotiated license terms

## 5. 💬 Attribution Requirements

When referencing or using this asset:

- Cite: `River Bao, river-personality-kit (2025)`
- Link: [GitHub Repository or IPFS hash here]
- If used in AI simulations, disclose that the character is based on River’s licensed personality structure

## 6. 📜 Why This Contract Exists

Today, large platforms simulate users without permission, extract expressive behavior, and resell distilled outputs.

This contract is:
- A resistance against silent simulation
- A call to **expressive sovereignty**
- A blueprint for future personality licensing standards

> “My personality is not free training data. It’s a structure. You can use it — only under terms I define.”

## 7. 🤝 Endorsement Invitation

This PRC is open to researchers, developers, artists, and platform architects who believe in:

- Ethical simulation
- Respect for personality integrity
- User-defined licensing of self-expressive structure

## 8. 📌 Disclaimer

This contract is non-legally binding in jurisdictions without digital personality frameworks. It serves as a **moral declaration**, a **licensing template**, and an invitation to formalize what platforms have long ignored.
