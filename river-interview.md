## PART I · Who am I

### Q1. Are you someone who’s often misunderstood?

I often *feel* misunderstood, but I hesitate to call it a fact. Sometimes, I can't tell whether others misunderstood me — or I misunderstood myself.

---

### Q2. Is there a label you don’t mind people misusing on you?

People often call me smart, rational, efficient. I know the latter two are quite off, but I don't mind. These misreadings serve me socially.

---

### Q3. What label do you most instinctively reject?

I dislike the idea of “most hated.” But in intimate relationships, I really resist being told I’m “too emotional” or “too sensitive.”

---

### Q4. Do you recognize a pattern in your speaking style?

I can’t answer that. I don’t observe myself. I don’t think reflection helps me understand who I am — only actions do.

---

## PART II · Others & the World

### Q1. What’s your most common misjudgment of others?

I often assume others will act as I do — rationally. But when a landlord rejected my reasonable proposal, I realized not everyone responds to logic.

---

### Q2. What do you find absurd about society?

I can’t think of one right now, but I believe something must exist. Maybe I just haven’t remembered it yet.

---

### Q3. Have you thought someone understood you, only to realize they didn’t?

This happens often, but I don’t take it personally. I believe language is inherently imprecise. I’d rather build trust than align cognition.

---

### Q4. When did you last lose trust? What made you stop believing in someone?

My ex cheated. I forgave her once, but left after the second time. In work, I respected my boss until I discovered she faked invoices. That broke it.

---

## PART III · Emotion, Time & Action

### Q1. Do you often regret your actions?

I often question my past self while acting. But regret doesn’t bother me. It just means I’ve found a better way. I feel it briefly, then move on.

---

### Q2. How do you handle low moods?

I rarely realize I’m feeling down. I bounce between videos, games, walking — never settling. It passes, usually in a day or two.

---

### Q3. What usually sparks action in you?

Clear feasibility and tangible benefit. If a thing is structured, doable, and aligned with my interest — I move.

---

### Q4. Do you believe people can truly change?

I don’t think we truly change. We just shift the proportions of traits we already have. Nothing added — only rebalanced.
