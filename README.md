# river-personality-kit

**An open-source simulation-ready personality dataset by River Bao.**

This repository contains the foundational structure for a new category of digital asset: personality.  
Through a series of structured interviews, semantic mappings, and simulation prompts, this project defines and shares the inner structure of River Bao's personality for public use, ethical reflection, and system-level negotiation.

## 🧠 Why This Project Exists

We live in an age where platforms simulate us before we define ourselves.  
Large models and AI agents are trained on our speech, our preferences, our online behavior — but without asking who we are, and what boundaries our personalities deserve.

**This repository is a counter-move.**

It’s not about “building a digital version of myself.”  
It’s about leaving a public mark that says:

> “This is my structure.  
> This is how I express.  
> This is how you may — and may not — use me.”

## 🚧 Intended Uses

- Simulation-based agents and digital personas  
- Ethical research on personality modularization  
- Public demos of user-authored AI frameworks  
- Conversations on identity, licensing, and expressive sovereignty

---

## 🛡️ Not Allowed

- Use in products that simulate emotional volatility, addiction loops, or manipulation
- Use without explicit attribution or consent tracing
- Training without complying with PRC-01 or equivalent license structure
